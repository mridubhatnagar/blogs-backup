## Year 2021 Good Read: Let's Talk Money by Monika Halan (Book Gist)

The school does not introduce you to money. Adding to that if you chose to do engineering. The engineering curriculum gives you no exposure to money. Not every home openly discusses money.

And, just like that, you make it to your first job. Earn the first paycheck and the money journey starts. When the in-hand salary comes less than CTC. You too must have felt. But.. no one told me that so many deductions are bound to happen?

With this book, Monika Halan explains personal finance from an absolute beginner level. No jargons. Throughout the book, she shares actionable insights from the Indian context on How you can make money work for you?

1. Have 3 accounts. Income account, spend-it account, and Invest-it account. As soon as the income comes. Some percentage of income should be transferred to the spend-it and invest-it accounts. Make it a self-imposed constraint to not take out or transfer any amount from the invest-it account to your expense account. 

2. Before you start investing. Start building an emergency fund. An emergency fund should be 6-12 months of your expenses. It also answers where to keep your emergency fund?

While a lot of mis-selling happens in the insurance market. It can be overwhelming to navigate alone and select the right product. A lot of mis-selling also exists because commission and incentives are given on every sale. What they are recommending to you might not be what you need.

5. When buying health insurance lookout for what is covered? What is not covered? Is your insurance co-pay? Is it cashless? Which hospitals are listed under the policy?

Is the room rent included in the cover from day 1? What happens if the insured person has any pre-existing illness? From when can you raise a claim for pre-existing illness?
