Too late to reflect upon the year that passed by. Nonetheless, as they say, better late than never.

Will divide the article into different sections. And, put some light on what was done.

## Personal Life

Lost my father in December 2021. Coming to terms with this reality has been tough. I started to live one day at a time. In the process, during early 2022. I read a lot. Wrote a lot. Felt lost.

## Work

Grateful to be working with the team I love and enjoy working with. Responsible to handle one critical service end-to-end single-handedly. Did RCA for production issues, and fixed the issues. Worked on enhancements, and maintenance. Every contribution has helped in making the service robust and stable.

It was all possible with the support and help of my teammates. Being part of a good team is peace of mind.

## Books Read

It was difficult to focus on anything. Be it life's lows or good times. Every time books have been the saviour. Maybe a couple more that I have probably forgotten.

* The Linchpin - Seth Godin
    
* The Dip - Seth Godin
    
* The Practice - Seth Godin
    
* Attitude is Everything
    
* Atomic Habits
    
* The Psychology of Money
    
* Being Happy
    

## Places Visited (Travel)

One of the known perks of being part of a remote organization is you can work from anywhere. Below is the list of places I visited. The list is in no particular order.

* Rishikesh - It started from here. Visited twice in the same year.
    
* Mumbai
    
* Lonavala
    
* Kamshet
    
* Pondicherry
    
* Ahmedabad
    
* Hyderabad
    
* Faridabad
    
* Delhi
    
* Pune
    
* Chennai
    

## Food and Fitness

* Managed to shed significant weight over some months. Successfully, able to maintain the weight loss.
    
* Gave attention to what I am eating. Rather, than having everything that served.  
    More protein-rich food, fewer carbs. No refined flour as much as possible.
    
* During the initial months of 2022. Walked a lot consistently. Though a lot of it was to come to terms with grief.
    
* Did gym consistently for 2 months for the first time in my life. Post that it didn't work out.
    
* Irregular yoga.
    
* Started cooking meals.
    

## Adventure Experiences Lived

### Inflatable Kayaking

Did inflatable kayaking in Rishikesh with **Team4Adventure** for 2 consecutive days. An inflatable kayak is somewhat similar to a raft. However, only for 2 people. Negotiated some rapids, got flipped out of the kayak, and jumped into the river multiple times.

Jumped from India's Highest Bungee Point with a height of 83 metres by Jumpin Heights in Rishikesh.

### Instructional Paragliding

From Rishikesh, I was off to Mumbai. And, hence found it a good opportunity to try instructional paragliding at Kamshet by **Temple Pilots**.

## End Note

That's a wrap from my end. That's all I did.  
Grateful to the universe for whatever is given. And, everything I managed to do.
