I got tagged by [Yeshwanth in her blog](https://swamiyeswanth.com/blog/blog-questionnaire/) to take up this blog questionnaire.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place ?

**Backstory**  
During my college days. I was fortunate to come across someone who I felt was doing more than what I have seen majority of people in my vicinity do. More in the sense, it was more than eat, sleep, work, repeat. He was able to pursue his passion as a lifestyle treks, kayaking, outdoors etc.  
This was new for me. One clarity that I got during those days was I want to lead a life like this. There needs to be more to life.  
  
Fortunately, soon after college. When I got my internship. I got location Bangalore. Bangalore, was somehow the city I always wanted to visit. And, so far could never. Even before reaching Bangalore. I had done all the research about what all community events happen, when they happen. Outdoors being the main focus. As, I started living the life I had envisioned because of the person who inspired me. I wanted to somehow convey it them what am I doing and how are things.

Coming back to why I start blogging. I used to hope, that maybe this person will read by chance. Though, that never happened. ðŸ˜…

### What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

Currently, I am using Hashnode. When I started I was using [Medium](https://mridubhatnagar.medium.com/). When it comes to selecting blogging platform. I have gone through a lot of analysis paralysis regarding should I built one on my own, what tech stack to use, should I use existing, CMS or static site generator and a bunch of other questions. Due to all this writing started to take a hit. Frequency of blogs published significantly reduced.

Hashnode had got newly launched that time. They were having this feature of backing up all the blogs on github. Seeing this. Without much thinking I went ahead with it. Could have attempted to built. But, again focus was writing. In trying to get the tech right. I didnâ€™t want writing to become secondary focus.

### How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard thatâ€™s part of your blog?

Less the complexity, lesser the friction. I directly create draft on hashnode and publish it.

### When do you feel most inspired to write?

1\. When I have lived a new experience.  
2\. When I have things to say about society. What society expects and how I see the same things.  
3\. In the insta age. It is has boiled down to life highlights. I believe in showcasing learning journey. When I am learning a new skill. I like to log my learning journey.  
4\. When I keep thinking about one topic based on what I am experiencing in life. And, I want to get it out of my head.

### Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

Most of my blogs are thoughts, feelings, emotions. They are raw, unfiltered. I publish it immediately.

### Whatâ€™s your favorite post on your blog?

Never gave it a thought. :)

### Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

Less likely, as I feel it is lot of effort to migrate. From a long time thinking of migrating all old blogs from Medium to hashnode. Have never been able to prioritize it.  
  
Though if at all in future I do plan to. Then, reason for doing would be that readers are not able to comment or react on my current posts unless they have account on hashnode. Which is sad :(.
