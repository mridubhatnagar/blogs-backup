Somewhere around last year I started a new hobby i.e solving jigsaw puzzles. I came across a jigsaw puzzle community based out of Bangalore. And, happen to join their whatsapp group. Turned out it wasn‚Äôt limited to Bangalore folks. There were folks from PAN India. They solved the jigsaw puzzles and use to share puzzle pictures in the group. That is how I got started.

To the best of my memory I don‚Äôt remember if in childhood I ever solved jigsaw puzzles. Exploring, trying and learning new activities every now and then has taught me one thing. Everything has its own progression. Starting with the toughest is a sure shot way to get frustrated and quit.

However, in India. I have seen all jigsaws being marketed for 6+ year old kids. And, seeing this adults feel puzzles are not meant for us. They are for kids. On telling adults others about jigsaw puzzles or hosting jigsaw puzzles often leads to a giggle. Grown up doing jigsaw? Meh ..

After having solved around 12+ puzzles over a year. I can tell you there is some challenge for all. They are not just for ‚Äúkids‚Äù. There are puzzles for adults. When I explored market outside India. I found out that there they have puzzles marketed for families, senior citizens. While puzzle stays the same, every piece is of different size depending on the age. Small pieces are for middle aged, medium for kids and bigger pieces for senior citizens.

Patients recovering from critical illness like Dementia, Alzheimer, stroke. Are often recommended jigsaw puzzles for cognitive rehabilitation.

## What types of puzzles and piece counts are available ?

1\. **Cardboard Puzzles** - Starting from 20-30 pieces to 2000 pieces or even maybe more is available.  
2\. **Wooden Puzzles** - All pieces are wooden. Pieces have whimsical shapes. This adds on to the challenge.  
3\. **Acrylic Puzzles** - Not as common.

## Ways you can increase the challenge ?

There are several ways you can up the challenge.

1\. Solving higher number of piece counts eg. 500-1000 pieces.  
2\. Solving puzzles which have different piece shapes rather then one with standard piece shapes.  
3\. Puzzle having a difficult picture. Less color variation.  
4\. Solve puzzles which have only color gradients no objects.  
5\. Try puzzles with irregular boundary, shape. Rather than regular straight boundary.

Below is one of the challenging ones I solved last month.

## Progression in Jigsaw Puzzle?

To each their own. Sharing my journey and progression with jigsaw puzzles.  
Started with solving a cardboard puzzle of 150 pieces. Did 4-5 more puzzles of 150 pieces. When, I felt like I can explore more. I am able to do them. Explored wooden puzzles piece counts ranging from 70-140 pieces. Solving a higher piece count puzzle first and then moving to a puzzle with lower piece count doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate that you are regressing instead of progressing. It simply implies the puzzle can have some different challenge. This is how I see it.

## Why jigsaw puzzles?

Some time back at the book meetup. I was having a conversation with someone. Hot topic as usual was fiction vs non fiction. And, he quoted ‚ÄúAt least reading non fiction feels like having some purpose to read the book. Unlike in fiction.‚Äù As we grow up, I think we start to see everything from the perspective of what will this activity help me learn? At times have started drawing random conclusions from events and occasions and to make it a social media post. In the process, often losing the point that some activities can only be for fun, to unwind and relax. In this hyper connected world.

All that being said, if you are still interested in knowing the why‚Äôs. Here is list of things solving jigsaws can help with.

1\. **Patience** - Patience isn‚Äôt a pre-requisite to start jigsaw puzzling. It is something that can be developed.  
2\. **Focus and concentration** - Almost everyone complains about how attention timespan is getting shorter. As a result of consuming short form content, youtube shorts, reels, tweets. Jigsaw is one of the ways to turn it other way around. Don‚Äôt complain, take action.  
3\. **No screen time** - Gives you opportunity to be away from doom scrolling.  
4\. **Sense of achievement** - Each completed puzzle gives sense of achievement.

## Can help improve skills we take for granted.

1\. Fine Motor skills  
2\. Hand-Eye coordination.  
3\. Attention to detail - Trains the brain to notice subtle differences in color, shape, pattern.

Puzzle once solved is waste ? Won‚Äôt do it again?

1\. There is a whatsapp group to sell your pre-loved puzzles. You can either sell the puzzle, or if multiple people are interested in buying. You can auction. Group has rules everyone adheres too. Group runs on trust. Shipping cost is usually born by the person buying your puzzle.

2\. Ever considered framing puzzles ? They look beautiful, and cardboard puzzles can be framed.

3\. Puzzle Library - There is a whatsapp community i.e Puzzle Library. You can put on their page. Share your puzzle with others, try out puzzles posted by others. It has some rules regarding how can one participate in it. I haven‚Äôt explored it yet.

That‚Äôs all. This was more of a brain dump about everything I learned over time about jigsaw puzzles. On and off seeing pictures couple of friends, cousins did reach out and show interest. If you have been still at the fence. This is your sign, its never too old to try anything new. üòä

May mindfully putting pieces in place give you peace and happiness. Happy puzzling. üß©
