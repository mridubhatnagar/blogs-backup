I have been religiously practising yoga for more than a year now. I have attended classes both in online and offline format. I often get asked by my friends "Whom are you learning from? Even we are interested in joining yoga classes". As soon as I respond "I am learning through online classes."  
I feel they take a step back.

Below I share the benefits of each type of class. Based on what you prioritise. You can choose one.

# Benefits of Online Classes

1\. You can carry your mat anywhere. Travelling is not an excuse for not showing up on the mat. (PS: Paid more, moved from dorm rooms to bigger rooms at times. Just to be able to show up on the mat. And, not miss the classes.)  
2\. If you live in a tier-1 metro city. And, you don't have any good instructor close by. Attending online classes will save your commute time. Time spent in getting stuck in the traffic can be used for learning a new skill.  
3\. If you live in a tier-2, tier-3 city. Struggling to find a good professional instructor in your city. Online is your way to go. Learn from the best.  
4\. If you are someone who is not comfortable with anyone touching your body. Opt for online. Alignment correction is through verbal cues.  
5\. Most likely batch size is smaller than the batch size in offline classes.

# Benefits of Offline Classes

1\. Works as a opportunity to make new friends who are interested in similar activity as you are.  
2\. When practising advance asanas. The instructor can stand besides you. And, can save you from falling.  
3\. Alignment correction. In some classes, instructors correct the alignment by moving your hand/body part.  
4\. Breathing techniques. In offline, the instructor is standing close to you. They will be able to listen to your breath. Correct you as and when needed.

## Apart from the mentioned factors. In my opinion choose the class which has

1\. Good and experienced instructor.  
2\. Smaller batch size.  
3\. Gives personal attention.  
4\. Reduces friction. Don't choose a class which is so far that everyday you have traffic as an excuse for not showing up.  
5\. Don't choose online if you aren't motivated enough to show up alone on the mat. Without others by your side.

If you are looking for general fitness activities and socialisation. Instead, of specialisation. Then, I think places like **cult** are the place to go.

Purpose behind writing this piece is to save your time from indecisiveness. And, share my experience of attending both online and offline class.

**Hope, you show up on your mat soon!!**
