## Seeking guarantee in an uncertain world

Life in itself is uncertain. But, the human mind loves assurance, reassurance, certainty.
As human mind loves assurance. People sell assurance. The consumer might not have realized but the seller knows that people love assurance. They'll buy assurance. And, hence they sell assurance. 

Remember reading?

- 10 kg weight loss guaranteed in 3 months
- Learn X in Y days
- Best before X months
- work hard and you'll be successful (bullshit)
- Dominos service guarantee of 30 minutes or pizza free
- Blinkit sells 10-minute grocery delivery at your doorstep

The happy consumer who seeks guarantee falls into the trap. Everything in life is governed by randomness. 

Burning midnight oil might increase the probability of a better future. But, there is no guarantee. Everyone has their own learning capacity and speed. It cannot be generalized if the learner will grasp what is taught in the mentioned time. 

10-mins or 30-mins delivery service is an uncertain bet. There are lot many variables involved. Neither the company nor the delivery agent knows if they'll be right there at your doorstep at the mentioned time. 

When the consumer doesn't get what they want in the guaranteed time. They go haywire.  Habitual of living a life with convenience. Forgetting the fact that nothing in this uncertain world comes with a guarantee. 

Do you know the only thing in life that is guaranteed?

Death :)
