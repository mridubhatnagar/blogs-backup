## February Experience: First 5K Marathon

Once every year the city I reside in hosts a Marathon. This year, the marathon was virtual. However, they had also made some arrangements for conducting it on the ground. Spread across 7 days anyone could complete their run anywhere. Upload the screenshot of distance traveled and time taken on the website.

I knew I wanted to experience it. At the venue, not at the location of my convenience. But, wasn't sure if 5K was my cup of it? And, second I wasn't someone who was training particularly for the Marathon. Racing thoughts? How much preparation is required beforehand? Will I be able to make it? 

Random thoughts based on assuming what a marathon is like. Would have resulted in making me quit before the start. I thought a better approach is to reach out to folks who have done it before. And, see what level of preparation is required. I reached out to one of my school friends to learn from her experience. Next, I reached out to my teammate who runs regularly, participates in marathons. My takeaway from our conversation was "Listen to your body." She emphasized, make sure to "Listen to your body."

Without any further delay. 7 days before I made up my mind. This had to be done. This year itself. Registered for the event. On Sunday 13th February reached the starting point Nehru Stadium. Along with a school friend. The route from there was to reach Daly College and return to the starting point.

On the way, there were beautiful trees, gardens on both sides of the road. Residency garden, Traffic Park, Radio Colony, Daly College, Agriculture Research Institute, Daly College Business School, the mighty shining sun, and Farmlands.

Marathon wasn't like a typical overcrowded marathon. Everyone was on their own. It was nice to see seasoned runners crossing you. One of them appeared to be talking out loud to himself. Powerful self-talk so that he finishes the run. 

One of the roads had no vehicle traffic. We could see Peahens, 5-7 dogs. The morning of 13th February while on the marathon also began with a strange encounter with dogs. Haha, survived and alive.

All throughout we had some nostalgic conversations. School athletic meet. 100 meter, 200 meters, relay races. From then to now how a lot of things changed. What was even funnier was that we were the ones who ran and at times won too??

Alternated between walking and jogging. At my usual walking pace. And, this was how the first-ever marathon was finished. It was fun. Found a new route for future cycling and walking trails.

Ps - All of a sudden deciding to go for a 5K marathon. Might result in cramps in the legs. Based on my conversation with a runner doing a proper 5K takes a minimum of 2 months of practice. If you are regular with the long walks. You would be comfortable alternating between walking and jogging. And, can do with less preparation. 

Also note, that I am no expert. No lessons, no takeaways, no threads. The experience was fun. I was happy. The sun was beautiful, so was everything around me.
