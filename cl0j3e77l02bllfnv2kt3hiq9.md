## Questions to answer before deciding to take a sabbatical?

Overworking might take a toll on well being of self. And, it might feel like leaving everything and escaping. At times, it might be for traveling. Irrespective of whatever is the reason behind the thinking of sabbatical. I think finding answers to the below-listed questions might help in figuring out "Hell Yeah, Sabbatical" or "No, not yet".  

1. What is the reason for thinking of taking a sabbatical?
2. What is the duration of your sabbatical?
3. What are your monthly expenses?
4. With no income will you be able to sustain your lifestyle?
5. Your savings can sustain you for how long?
6.  During your sabbatical if there is an unforeseen health emergency in the family. Will you be in a position to pay the bills?
7.  What do you plan to do during your sabbatical?
8. Do you have the skills required to crack interviews and get back to work when you desire?
9. How does your network look like? Are there people who are willing to vouch for you?
10. During the duration are there any big payments to make. Will you be able to do it with no income? (Think Insurance premiums, education fees, house rent, SIPs....etc)
11. Short-term and long-term consequences of taking a break?
12. Do you have dependents? With your savings will they be able to sustain?

If the reason for thinking of taking a sabbatical is burnout. And, it is not possible to take a sabbatical. In my opinion, taking short breaks. Reducing the amount of work. All these things can help. 

Writing because I have been there, done that. The decision to quit was an abrupt one with no planning. Things did go south. The reason for the call was burnout. And, due to the severity of burnout, I couldn't really think through it. Quitting seemed the right thing to do.

This is written to think through the process before making any decision if anytime in the future the need arises.  

Ps: 

1. If your answer to taking a sabbatical is "Hell Yeah". During your sabbatical also find an answer to give to the HRs of the next employer "Why is there a career break on your resume?" :D 

2. If you yourself can become a dependent. And, you have parents you can fall back on. The game is altogether different. There is no need to find answers to the above-mentioned questions in that case.
