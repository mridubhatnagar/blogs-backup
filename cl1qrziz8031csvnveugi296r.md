## April, Good Read: Being Happy by Andrew Mathews (Book Gist)

In the everyday grind, the mind often oscillates between past events and the future. Forgetting that being happy costs nothing. The present is all we have. Past is gone. The future is yet to come. Have we forgotten to be happy? Or for you being happy is tied to an outcome?

## Ideas to Remember:

1. Mind forms patterns. The mind acts as a magnet. Think positively about yourself and your circumstances. Consistently visualize life working out as you want it. You'll be creating happiness patterns. 

2. Be gentle with yourself. Accept yourself and love yourself. And, acknowledge that even up until now you have been living life the best way your know how.

3. Your mind is the architect of your body, and your body is a reflection of your thoughts. If you are consumed by fear and anger and unexpressed emotion your body will reflect it. The dis-ease in the mind becomes a dis-ease in the body. Once we recognize that our thoughts shape our health we are halfway to creating better health. 

4. If you are serious about changing your life, get serious about what surrounds you.

5. Your conscious and your subconscious thoughts are always creating results in your life. What you think is what you get. 

6. Continually stretch your belief system as to what is possible for you to achieve. 

7. All you have is now. The measure of our peace of mind and the measure of our personal effectiveness are determined by how much we are to live in present moment. Regardless of what happened yesterday and what might happen tomorrow. NOW is where you are.

8. The thing about being happy is that when you are happy you are mostly involved with the present. We decide to be happy on the journey, and not just when we reach our destination.

9. Living in the now also means we enjoy whatever we are doing for its own sake and not just for the end result.

10. You are only open to intense fear when you are inactive. The minute you start to take action and actually DO SOMETHING, the fear subsides.

11. Jump into life at every opportunity. Live in the now. While you are waiting for one thing to happen, do something else. In doing so, you demonstrate a certain detachment from the end result. LETTING GO OF THE SITUATION, ACCELERATES THE RESULTS.

12. We are responsible for the limitations we place on ourselves. 

13. Wherever you are, it is the place to start. The effort you expend today does make a difference.
