I feel 'real adulthood' started after graduation. When, there were tons of decisions to make. Along with times when there was no decision to make. Life happened. Below are the list of things I learned. Amidst the chaos.

1\. The more people with varied experiences you meet. The more your mindset broadens (provided you have an open mind).  
2\. There is more to life. Then being glued to your day's job.  
3\. All of us have been given different set of cards. Only thing that is in our control is how we play the cards.  
4\. Have the courage to stand up for yourself. Otherwise, every other person will step over you.  
5\. If you don't take the decision. Someone else will take it for you. And, you are the one who'll have to bear the consequences.  
6\. Everyone should be independent. Be it parents or children. Only, then life can be enjoyed in its true sense.  
7\. Fear of breakup shouldn't stop one from getting into a relationship.  
8\. Travel, Travel, Travel.  
9\. If possible interact with people from other countries. Their culture, their thought process, their way of living.  
10\. Have a hobby/passion. When it feels tough to even make it to the next day. Or you question your existence. Having activity that you love to do will help you stay afloat.  
11\. Take care of your mental health and physical health. Their is no either or between the two.  
12\. Having a degree/certificate might open the door. Ultimately, it is the skill that will make you employable. Focus on the later.  
13\. Being a bit selfish is okay. If you aspire to do something meaningful.  
14\. Making decisions is hard. If you are in a position where your decision has an impact on others. Be it family or employees anyone.  
15\. Don't fantasise anyone. Each one of us has different experiences and circumstances. Maybe their circumstances were ideal for what they wanted to achieve.  
16\. There are limited things in our control.  
17\. Being positive cannot guarantee that all good things happen to you. But, being negative is the worst and a endless trap. It keeps you devoid of even acknowledging the possibility of having silver lining in the dark cloud.  
18\. Always keep learning.  
19\. Be grateful for everything you have.  
20\. Don't take any decision in haste.  
21\. Societal pressure is real. Each one of us is conditioned in some way. Navigating against what is considered 'normal' by the society is challenging.  
22\. Don't give advice. Until someone asks you for it.  
23\. Don't judge anyone. As long as what they are doing is making them happy. I am no one to comment on how something 'should' or 'should not' be done.  
24\. Loved ones are not here to stay forever. Neither are you going to stay here forever. Hold on to your interests, hobbies. Find them when their is time. They will help you stay afloat. When you don't want to.  
25\. To be able to do anything consistently. Keep asking yourself "Why, you started doing it in the first place?". When the why is strong enough. You'll do it any how.  
26\. Be kind. Everyone is living a part of life that is not visible to you.  
27\. When someone has an opinion contrary to yours. If the discussion is turning into a fight. Stop, agree to what they have to say, leave. In the end, you do you. Or respond to them based on what they want to hear.  
28\. Not everyone will like or will agree to whatever decisions you are taking in life. It is okay. In the end, it is your life.  
29\. Read Books. They broaden perspective. And, sometimes work as an escape from reality.  
30\. Money is important.  
31\. Learning any new skill takes time. There are no shortcuts.  
32\. Have the courage to take the decision today. So, that some years down the line you don't look back and blame someone else for your present.  
33\. Passion is not something that'll come to you. And, you'll realise this is my passion. Passion needs exploration. Once you start to learn something and manage to continue doing it for long enough. It makes you happy. I think that is what can be called as Passion.

Still not able to follow everything that is learned and written. Reason for putting it down was to declutter the mind. Would be nice to come back and read. Everything is easier said than done.
