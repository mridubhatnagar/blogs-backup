# Reflection 2022

3 days more before the year ends. I thought to sit and reflect on how the year has passed by. The beginning of the year went by just trying to figure out what next. From here where?

## January to March

1. Was at my lowest point when it comes to mental health. Was trying to cope with the sudden loss.
    
2. Consistently walked. 4km to 5 km. I used Strava for tracking distance. Completed Strava monthly walking challenges. 50km in a month.
    
3. Took care of the food I ate. And, what I was including in my diet. Consulted a nutritionist who helped for 3 months. Lost quite a lot of weight. And, came into good shape.
    
4. Maybe to escape reality. Read quite a lot of books and wrote a lot of write-ups.
    
5. On and off was swimming and practising yoga.
    

# April to July

1. In April end went on a 7 days solo trip to Rishikesh. Attempted bungee jumping. And, for 2 days did inflatable kayaking in class 3+ rapids.
    
2. In May first week. We had our office onsite in Mumbai. Was in Mumbai for 5 days. It is fun and a blessing to be with a team with whom you get along well. Most of us shared the same interest in the outdoors it seems. Every morning at 6 AM we used to go to some or other beach. Played a lot of table tennis for a long time. I reached a day before. Which made it possible to catch up with school friends too. :D
    
3. During our onsite, we have an activity where we give appreciation cards to whomsoever we wish to thank in the team. Surprisingly, I received lots of cards. With beautiful messages. It was heartwarming.
    
4. From Mumbai travelled solo to Lonavala. Did Instructional Paragliding. What an amazing experience this was. :o)
    
5. From Lonavala, travelled to Pune. And, from Pune back to my hometown.
    
6. Stayed at hostels. Met many new folks. Played a lot of table tennis.
    
7. At Pune hostel. Had a casual conversation with him. He was explaining to me how he encourages his daughter to practice adventure. Loved the perspective. And, I was quite happy with what he was doing.
    
8. Taking care of what I eat has become part of my lifestyle. No binge eating, no chips, no biscuits, no refined flour.
    
9. On and off yoga and swimming continued.
    
10. For the first time participated in a 5k Marathon. A school friend joined me. Consistent walks helped in completing the marathon with ease. Though I was walking.
    

## August to October

1. Joined a gym for the first time in my life. Managed to consistently go to the gym for 2 months. Phew.
    
2. Travelled to Delhi. Delhi to Rishikesh. 7 days. This time I was on a workcation. Something broke in production during the exact same time. Ha ha. Nonetheless, the experience was nice.
    
3. Apart from working. It was beautiful to sit on the rocks near the river in the evening. And, just be. All I could see was the river, big hills, highway, and greenery and by chance, someone was playing the flute around. Outdoors and live music.
    
4. My Brother, relatives and cousins were home for Diwali. Diwali was of course, unlike other times. After a long time, all were together. Playing Uno and monopoly was fun.
    
5. Started learning Javascript.
    

# November to December

1. In November, took my mother on a weekend trip to Ahemdabad. It was a beautiful feeling to be able to arrange everything on my own. All she had to do was come along. Had a traditional Gujrat breakfast, and spent mornings and evenings at the riverfront, the remaining time at cafes.
    
2. In December, attended a physical conference after a long time. Went to Hyderabad over a weekend. PyConf Hyderabad, Walk around Hussain Sagar Lake, Dinner at Autumn Leaf Cafe, and Lunch at chutneys are some of the beautiful memories from the Hyderabad trip.
    
3. Completed building Number Game project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
    

## Professional Life

Grateful and blessed to be part of a supportive team. Satisfied with people, work and workplace. Place of work plays a key role in peace of mind. Thankful to everyone in the team.

From being at a point where programming seemed impossible and a thing that only highly intellectual ones do. The present time is when I am managing a team fresher who has recently joined my team. It has been a beautiful journey. Thankful to my mentor.

To everyone who has stood beside me during this year. Thank you so much. Forever Grateful.

# Other things that have changed

1. Significantly reduced time spent on social media doom scrolling. Improved well-being.
    
2. Managed to not debate and rant on Twitter about anything. Ranting there is not going to solve the problems.
    
3. Atheist by nature. No god and no spiritual leader I follow. There are quite a lot of things that haven't yet made sense to me. I have started to believe in the universe.
    
4. Resumed practising yoga again. Hopefully, this time will maintain consistency.
    
5. Next year looking forward to more travel, Scuba Diving, Kayaking. Hopefully, trekking will get materialized too.
