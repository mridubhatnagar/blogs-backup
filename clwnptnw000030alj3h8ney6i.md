Have been thinking since quite some time to write about this. It has been over a year of showing up on my yoga mat. One and a half year of practicing yoga. Through the lows and highs. Yoga has stayed.

## Why I started yoga?

1\. There was a time in life (2 years back) when my father passed away. And, I started questioning about existence. Why even live when ultimately we are all going to die. I was discussing the same with someone. And, they suggested me. **To have something in life that you look forward too. Bitter truth about life is.**

This single thought/perspective. Struck a cord with me. We spend our life's focused on people. Doing everything for them. And, when they are no more with us. We are lost. We don't have anything to hold on to anymore.

Have an activity that you love practicing.

2\. Stress. Either you are someone who has been playing the cards right. And, balancing career and relationships. Or sailing in the boat similar to mine. Marriageable age. You haven't found a partner. And, from family, relatives to friends there is only one discussion. Marriage? Have you started seeing someone?  
To be honest, last 1 year. I had started to withdraw myself. From meeting relatives  
and friends alike.

3\. I have seen first hand. What happens when you don't take care of your health.  
After father's passing away. One thing was to start taking care of own health.

4\. I enjoy playing outdoors. Some years back I had tried White Water Kayaking. Couldn't do it. Being physically fit seemed the way to be able to give it a shot  
again.

## **Why I stayed with Yoga?**

I didn't stay for the fancy poses that one sees on Instagram. Infact until last year, I wasn't even on Instagram. So, I wasn't aware what all exists in yoga.

Sharing from experience that those 60 minutes on the mat. I found it to be peace amidst chaos. You focus on your breath, you are mindful about every action. Another observation was any day when mind had racing thoughts on the mat. I failed at doing even the simplest of asanas. This observation was strong enough to make me stay.

In one of the yoga workshops I recently attend. They had beautifully summarized **what is yoga?**

*"Yoga is detachment from your attachment to suffering".*

## What has changed?

1\. Overtime I feel my **focus has improved**. Which helped me at my work. In the times when there are several things that can distract you. I have been able to shut everything else and focus at the task at hand.

2\. **Trust in the process, faith, positive outlook**. There were times when I used to fight to get into achieve a asana. Thinking this is the end goal. Now, focus is only on practice. I take out some time to self practice apart from my regular yoga class timings. And, just keep trying things that I wasn't able to do in class. Or can get with a bit of practice keeping the technique in mind.

3\. **Increased self Esteem, self confidence.** Staying consistent is considered difficult. When you have managed to do something that is considered difficult. It feels good.

4\. I am a person who is super stiff. (My teacher would know). Girls usually are into some form of dancing. So, body is a bit flexible. However, yours truly is not. From then to now we have traveled a fair enough distance. Here, is a short glimpse.

5\. Started eating healthy and bit of cooking on and off.

6\. Learning something new everyday. When you are constantly learning. Life doesn't feel monotonous.

Grateful for this journey. Grateful for being able to stay consistent with the practice. And, grateful to have found a good teacher and a good yoga school. :o)
