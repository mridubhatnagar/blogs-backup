**Disclaimer** - These are notes and takeaway from re-reading **Chapter 2 - Don't Stash that cash** from Monika Halan's book on personal finance **Let's Talk Money**.

1\. Have 3 separate bank accounts. Label each of the accounts **Income Account**, **Spend-it** account and **Invest it** account respectively.

2. As soon as you receive take home salary in your **income account**. Move atleast 40-45% of your take home salary to **spend-it account**. EMI payouts should not be more than 25-30% of your take-home income. Move 15-20% of your take home salary to **invest-it account**. Savings should at-least be 15-20% of take-home income.

3. **Set a calendar alert** if the month ahead has premium payment due for a medical, house, car, term plan and move that much more money to take care of additional spend.
    

## Steps to do if you have a partner

4\. You and your spouse/brother/sister whoever contributes in your household expenses both should have a joint account into which both credit equal amounts for monthly spending.

5\. Each partner has a separate invest-it account in different banks.

4\. Follow this and monitor each of your accounts for 3 months. This way you would be able to identify if your spending's are more, are your savings on track?

5\. Moving money from invest-it account to spend-it account is not allowed.
