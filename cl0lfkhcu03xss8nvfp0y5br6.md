## How to decide which college to go to?

I was thinking about this problem statement for the last couple of days. Here, is what I have come up with. This is also written because the last 2 years have been really tough for families. Young kids have lost parents. If you happen to be someone at the crossroads. I hope this write-up helps you and you find your way through.  

Here is a list of questions for you to answer and find the answer for yourself.

1. Based on your entrance exam score what are the list of colleges you can choose from?

2. Gather the following information for all colleges of your choice:
      - Course curriculum
      - Placements
      - Location
      - Education Fee
      - Alumni Network
      - Brand Name
      - Faculty

3. Rank the following factors. Rank from 1-6. The most important factor is ranked 1. The least important factor is ranked 6. 
      - Course curriculum
      - Placements
      - Location
      - Education Fee
      - Alumni Network
      - Brand Name
      - Faculty

4. Look at the college data you have. For each check which college is offering you the thing which is most important to you?

#### Some Examples:

1. Suppose the only thing that matters to you is brand name. Out of the list of colleges that you can choose from pick the college that is a brand. 
2. If the placement and a good alumni network are what you value. Then choose the one which offers that. Let go of the brand name. And, other factors as they are of lower importance to you.

## What if you land in the wrong college?
There are trade-offs sure. But, nothing ground-breaking happens. You can make your way through.

- Make good friends. Learn from them. 
- Reach out to faculties. (Luck, if you find what you are looking for)
- Focus on skill-building. Internet is at your disposal.


## Word Of Caution

1. Colleges are businesses. Websites are for marketing. Good enough possibility that truth is not being sold. Reach out to people.
2. Debating on the choice of college is a waste of time. Often, we forget the fact that the factor that is of value to you might not be the factor that is of value to me.

More options lead to a paradox of choice. If there are no options. Probably no need to think through. :)
