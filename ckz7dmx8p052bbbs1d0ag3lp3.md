## Core Ideas

1. It is easy and the brain tricks us so that we do the easiest task first. Eat the ugliest frog first. Meaning doing the hard things first. 

2. Before picking the tasks. Give it time. If the task at hand is bigger. Break it down into as smaller tasks as possible. Keep striking each off one at a time. 

3. Bias for action. Don't confuse activity with accomplishment. Thinking through your plan before acting on it helps. 

4. Write a goal. Set a deadline. Make a list of everything that you can of that you are going to have to do to achieve that goal. Organize the list into a plan. List by priority.

5. Plan your day ahead. Always work with lists. Move the not yet accomplished tasks from the previous day to the next day.

6. Have different lists for different purposes. One list is your master list. From the master list create a daily list, weekly lists, monthly list of things to be done. Plan an entire week in advance.

7. 10/90 Rule says that the first 10 percent of the time you spend planning and organizing your work before you begin will save you as much as 90 percent of the time in getting the job done once you get started.

8. Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything also known as the Pareto principle. This principle says that 20 percent of your activities will account for 80 percent of your results. Let go of trivial tasks and do high-value tasks first.

9. "Only engage, and the mind grows heated. Begin it, and the work will  be completed." - Goethe (one-liner same as mentioned in the book)

10. Continually review your duties and responsibilities to identify time-consuming tasks and activities that you can abandon with no real loss. This is an ongoing responsibility for you that never ends.

11. Use the ABCDE method continuously. Write priority of the task against each task. An A item is defined as something that you must do. This is a task that will have serious positive and negative consequences. B item is should do but has mild consequences. C is nice to do. But, has no consequences at all. D is something you can delegate. E is something you can eliminate.

12. Identify key constraints that are holding you back from getting what you want?

13. Control your inner dialogue. I can do it. 

14. Develop a positive mental attitude. Keep your energy focused forward. 

15. Use time-blocking. Schedule your day into large chunks of time.

16. Take time out for self-care. Prioritize health. 

The book is crisp and contains highly actionable insights. Has a lot of questions for self-introspection going forward. Plan, Review, Reflect hours, days, months, year. Time is passing by, life is passing by.
