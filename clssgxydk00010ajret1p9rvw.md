Lately the whole world went online. Due to advancement in technology and the tools available at our disposal.

Be it working from home or rather working from anywhere, Learning skills online through online classes, food getting delivered at home and several other things.

While quite a lot of things can be done from inside four walls of your home. I believe environment plays a crucial role.

When we go for dining out. Many of you might have heard your parents say "Yeh toh hum ghar per hi bana lete". Of course, probably the meal you are served you can have it at home too. It is the ambience that increases the experience.

Any fitness activity can be done through the comfort of your home. Practising from a dedicated space helps you get motivated seeing your peers.

Remote work has its own pros and cons. However, in office space some things tend to get resolved faster than in a remote space.

Children are sent to school for education. Have heard these days parents are opting for home schooling. Maybe home schooling is good. But, when seen with other perspective going to school will give them more exposure. IMO, children should not be replica of their parents. When it comes to thinking, opinions, world view.

In the modern days. The boundaries are blurred. We are not fully vacationing when we go on vacation. We have our laptops with us.

An environment ideal for doing a activity increases the focus. Change in environment on and off is good.

PS: This was not written to debate what is better. Everyone has their own choices. And, remote work has its own benefits.
