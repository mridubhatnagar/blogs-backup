2024, came with its fair share of highs and lows. While I am glad near and dear ones are all with me. However, the loss nation experienced as such. Felt like some personal loss. Be it Paramaguru Sharath Jois,  
had I not gone and practiced in Mysore. Maybe I wouldn’t have felt it. Ustad Zakir Hussain, the name we have been reading since the school days, Mr. Ratan Tata he himself and his intiatives kept my faith in humanity alive. Dr Manmohan Singh’s contribution. It was felt because during his tenure I was in school. This was also the realization to do your own research and not rely on what media portraits to form your own opinion.

This is how my year went on a personal level.

1\. 🤸‍♀️ Took the leap of faith, enrolled for a month’s course under Yogacharya Bharath Shetty in Mysore. This was also a reward to self for staying consistent with the practice in 2023. Was fortunate to meet several practitioners from different places across the globe. Loved it so much, that ended up enrolling for March as well.

2\. 🧘‍♀️ In February, attended a workshop in Mysore on Yogic Philosophy and Asana Practice. While the asana practice was way beyond my level and it was intimidating to be inside a room full of yoga teachers. My key takeaway from the workshop was **“Yoga is detachment from your attachment to suffering”**. I have personally experienced it. On the mat, if your mind wanders. You are bound to fall or miss the instruction.

3\. 🙂 In Feb, after almost a year. We had hackathon and offsite. Lost the hackathon. Visited Dubare Elephant Camp. It was fun. Campfire night was one of the beautiful memories. Where whole team played Ware-wolf. What amazed me was how amazingly Thej hosted the game.

4\. 💔 Throughout the year, professionally performance was good. The service I developed and maintained had less escalations. Which gave me a little hope that maybe this year I might get some reward. Contrary to what was in my head. Company survived, the service got shut down, and I was laid off.

5\. 🧑‍💻 Studied, gave interviews. Giving interviews feels like going back to zero and climbing uphill. Though, when you are at rock bottom. Only way is up. Easier said, than experienced. 🎈

6\. 🥲 Had several disagreements, fought at home. Broke down several times throughout the year. When you have both parents. There are a ton of things that don’t reach you. And, get discussed and resolved between them. And, then when only one is left. Things start to hit you. There is no barrier.

7\. 😓 Stress impacted health. Good for women menstrual health signals you about stress. If you yourself are not ready to accept it.

8\. In June, saw the light of the day when I got selected to work for IITM Online BS Degree Program. Thej, took a chance on me and pivoted to fullstack. While majority companies ask for prior years of experience. I don’t think it can happen until someone takes a chance on you. Someone has to give a break. Otherwise, its all hobby projects.

9\. 🌈 🌧️ Somewhere close to IITM confirmation. Linkedin Learning reached out with an offer to update my existing course. Professionally, June was like a Rainbow in the dark cloud. In personal life, the dark cloud was still bringing rain. Extreme emotions. At home, when there are only 2 people. Other person’s mood takes a toll on you too. More so when you are sensitive. Thankful, that she is better now.

10\. 🦌🚴‍♀️🏊‍♀️🚶‍♀️ July, I was in IITM. Seeing the campus felt like living a dream. Met new people, cycled around the campus in lush green surroundings. Swam in the IITM pool, went for a stroll in their huge central library, Saw deer’s from so close. 18 year old Mridu, who failed at clearing JEE Advance forget IITM. Would not have imagined taking a stroll in IITM campus after 12 years down line. Universe surprises you in its own ways.

11\. 💃 August to October went in preparing content for the course, recording, takes and re-takes. Remotely recording from inside a Indian household is challenge. When there are tons of surrounding noises. From honking, to dog barks, processions and the list goes on. Nonetheless, had to wake up when everyone else sleeps. And, we made it. Recording was done. December, the course launched.

# Travel

Saw hills and the beaches, The most beautiful sunsets, some of the best scenic routes, roads covered with tree shed, tall trees on either sides, long walks and occassional cycling.

1\. Mysore  
2\. Bangalore  
3\. Dubare Camp (Near Coorg)  
4\. Chennai  
4\. Gokarna  
5\. Ooty ( As kids, whenever we played business. Always I used buy property in Ooty. No idea why. Visited the place on my own. Bought back memories of the game. And, smile that I am able to experience it live. )  
6\. Conoor  
7\. Pune

Travel experiences need a dedicated blog of its own. Maybe will write some time. Highlight being, all trips were solo. Met so many new folks probably 20+ this year. Laughed a lot, played a lot of games, banana boat ride, kayaked in the sea, stayed up till late at night, visited a lot of cafes, witnessed live music night and all 90’s folks singing Lucky Ali songs. Did the Gokarna Trek, Ate local delicacies with the locals like the Mangalore bun, filter coffee, soda etc. All of it mainly, happened in the last quarter of the year. Some of it in first quarter.

# Books Read 📚

1\. Yoga Sutra for Children - Roopa Pai  
2\. Bhagvat Gita for Children - Roopa Pai  
3\. Love Amongst the Bookshelves - Ruskin Bond  
4\. Days at the Morasaki Bookshop

Looking forward to reading more fiction novels this year. Though no goals, no targets ;)

# New Concepts learned

1\. Practiced Golang.  
2\. Built some end to end features. Frontend code went in production.  
3\. Attended workshop on yoga. One on inversions by Ramya. Another by RCP and Yogaprasad on Yogic Philosophy.  
4\. Attended workshop on Menstrual health. I think I understand it better now. The sanitary napkins that we use are non-biodegradable. And, take several years to decompose. Waste generated by 1 sanitary pad is equal to waste generated by 4 polythene. These pads contain several chemicals. Which are harmful for the body. And, there is no regulation on them.

# New Skills Acquired

1\. This was second year of staying consistent with yoga practiced. Though was not so consistent towards the year end because of travel or when we had no classes. Several asana’s unlocked. Efforts bore fruit.  
2\. 🤷 Learned to solve Rubiks cube. Tried to keep practicing it on and off. Trying to improve on my solving speed. Participated in some speed cubing competitions. Only, to find out I stand last in the tally.

1\. Rubiks cube
