## Love for Books and Bookstores

My heart is full. I'm grateful that in a world driven by technology. Good old physical books exist. I can pick the book up, flip the pages, smell the pages. 

Ads don't keep popping up. No, one wants me to click the ad. I have control over what I am reading. Unlike doom scrolling. You don't see others getting jobs. You are not seeing your friends getting married. There are no context-less quotes being written. No travel photographs. No paid walls. It's just you and the book. 

Bookstores are as special as the book. Enter the bookstore, glance through each and every bookshelf, every row. Pick the book you are curious to read. If the store is like Bahrisons, Landmark, Crosswords, Blossoms, Bookworm. You can actually sit in the bookstore and read your book. Start discussing good reads and strangers become friends. 

Books are solace. Reading books can make you smile. Books like The Kite Runner can make you feel how difficult are circumstances for some. For no real fault of theirs. Read The Little Prince and it'll make you think who you were as a child. And, how you are as an adult. If you never heard about the necessity of effectively using the time in hand. Productivity books like Eat that Frog, Deep Work is there for your rescue. Need to learn from other's stories read biographies, autobiographies. 


Books provide an escape from reality. Books help you learn what no one else told you about. Humans are complex. People leave, sometimes by God's will. Sometimes their own will. Books are your friends who won't leave you. Books for good times. Books when in tough times. When alone read books. When together read books.

Read Khalid Hosseini, James Clear, Derek Sivers, Tim Ferris, Richard Bach, Seth Godin, and many others. 
  

Finally, there is a little place for the ever-growing collection. I that hold dear.
