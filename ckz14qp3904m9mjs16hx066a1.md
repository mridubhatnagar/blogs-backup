## September 2021: Skandagiri Trek

In the 2nd week of September of 2021. We had our first on-site at our Bangalore HQ. After around a year of no travel. This gave me an opportunity to travel to the city I love the most, Bangalore. Bangalore is special for a multitude of reasons greenery, people,  fun events, places to visit, outdoors. Places from where you start your career are always dear. For me it was Bangalore.

I reached Bangalore on a Saturday afternoon. The whole week was planned with work meetings, agendas, some fun games. During the afternoon's team used to have lunch together. All of it felt like a breezing change. From the usual remote setup.

It was fun to see team members. All of us looked different in reality in comparison to how we looked in our best profile photographs. 

I have always enjoyed the outdoors. The whole week I was looking out online to see if there are any groups that I can join for doing a 1-day trek nearby. Due to covid restrictions. Sadly, I couldn't find any groups with matching schedules.

Friday night, an impromptu plan got made at the workplace. Let us go on a trek together. We had 2 options to choose from either Skandagiri or Savandurga. Savandurga seemed like a trek with a lot of boulders and less greenery. I was excited to do the Skandagiri trek. 

The same day we booked the traveler. All of us unanimously agreed on doing the Skandagiri trek. Morning 7 AM we were at the foothills of Skandagiri all set to ascend it.

The journey to the foothills made me recall my early days in Bangalore. I had done one-day treks to Nandi Durga, Uttari Betta twice. Weekend trek to Kodachadri. Adding 5th trek to the list of treks. Skandagiri it was. Skandagiri's terrain looked similar to that of Nandi Durga, Uttari Betta. Challenge wise Skandagiri seemed more difficult than the previous 1-day treks.

During the climb. I was observing and absorbing what I was seeing around me. I was avoiding talking in order to conserve some energy to climb. When we made it to the top we clicked a lot of pictures. One colleague preferred to do meditation for a few minutes. Some did planks. Just for fun. 

We also discussed each of our earlier outdoor experiences. One of them had done Paragliding at Kamshet. He completed the Manali Khardungla expedition on cycle. It was inspiring to listen to his experiences. I shared mine. 

Nandi Durga being the first trek ascend and descend both were challenging. A person I met on the trek had been on treks before. He taught me how to position the feet when you descend from the top. Ascend back then was difficult because of no experience and absolute zero fitness. 

While doing Skandagiri the ascend felt easier. However, when we started descending downhill. An old muscle pull caused probably while doing breaststroke. Started to cause trouble midway. In some places, it became a challenge to balance. Feet slipped. I slipped due to imbalance.

When you are right there. You have the excitement about finishing what you started. You experience a sense of achievement. The joy of getting the opportunity to at least go for it again. And, you do it anyhow.
