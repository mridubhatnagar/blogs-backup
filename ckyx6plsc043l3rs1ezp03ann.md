## What did I learn from loss?

Loss brings you closer to your own family<br />
Loss brings you closer to your friends<br />
Loss brings you closer to your people<br />

Loss reminds you that life is short ❤️<br />
It also reminds you that discussing personal life is absolutely fine. <br />
As long as it is making you feel better.<br />

24*7 it doesn't necessarily need to be about startup, productivity<br />  
Neither talks have to be about Twitter, Career, Hustle, etc.<br />
It's okay to be vulnerable. It is okay to have support systems.<br />

Loss also teaches that it is okay to break down<br />
Loss also teaches that once in a while it is okay to put your guards down<br />
Loss teaches you it is okay, to not be okay<br />

Loss teaches you to give things time<br />

Loss reminds you that life is short<br />
Be in touch with the ones you want to.<br />
Meet people, create memories.<br />
Write your heart out <br />
Don't shy away from clicking lots of photographs together.<br />

It teaches you there is also more to life than only work.<br />
It teaches you there is also more to life than only pursuing your own interests.<br />
There are people outside this who need your time and presence.<br />

It also teaches you to continue doing things that make you happy. 

Looking back it feels there are fewer pictures we clicked together.
Possibly due to my own camera shyness.
