It‚Äôs been a while since I am going to silent readers club on every Sunday. It has become something I look forward to each week. On and off I keep getting asked when each of you reader‚Äôs your own book. And, you can read even at home. Why go to a book club meetup? Here‚Äôs the thing.

1\. You meet bunch of other people who are as passionate for books as you are.  
2\. Post the reading session. Each of us briefly talks on what we read. Quite a lot of times the discussions become longer. I find it amusing to see spark in people‚Äôs eyes when they talk about book they love.  
3\. The enthusiasm and excitement of recommending new books to one another.  
4\. Each person can have altogether different interpretation and perspective about the same book.  
5\. At times it‚Äôs about disliking the same books. Going at length to tell others. Our reasons for disliking the book.  
6\. It‚Äôs also about shared feeling of buying books from bookstores, taking strolls in bookshops. Visiting cities only to see the local bookshops.  
7\. It feels good to see other readers share same fear as mine when it comes to bookshops. As a result, we keep advocating go and buy from bookshop. Don‚Äôt get it from Amazon.  
8\. It is interesting to see. How possessive each of us is when it comes to our books. It has gone to the extent that when asked about having a book exchange. Some of us were ready to buy a copy of the book and then give it. Instead of doing permanent exchange of our book.  
9\. Meetups also keep you on track with consistent reading. In case you are someone who needs accountability.  
  
Reading is an experience and emotion. Once you are into it. Life without books is unimaginable.

## *‚Äú A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one‚Äù .*  

Above quote is a famous quote by George R.R Martin. Listing below some of the books meetups that happen in different cities.

1\. Bangalore Bookies  
2\. Cubbon Reads (Bangalore)  
3\. HSR Reads(Bangalore)  
4\. Mumbai Bookies  
5\. Pune Bookies  
6\. Jaipur Bookies  
7\. Indore Reads  
8\. Silent Book Reading Club (Neighbourhood Cafe Indore)  
9\. HyderabadReads  
10\. TowerReads, Chennai  
  
There may be more meetups than listed. These are the one‚Äôs I know off. You don‚Äôt need to be a avid reader to be part of the meetup‚Äôs. People are more than happy to help you start. However, you need to take the first step my showing up for the meetups. :)  
  
Reading culture has to grow, bookstores need to stay. Heads down reading and discussing novels would be interesting to see. Rather than heads down doom-scrolling. Reading is an emotion, experience. Talk to reader, you‚Äôll know. üôÇ

Out of several things that might be happening to whine about. Reading culture making its way across India, tier 2 cities included. Is a positive change that I am quite proud off.  
  
PS: Reach out to me if you know of any more book meetups. I would love to update this list. Hope it helps.
