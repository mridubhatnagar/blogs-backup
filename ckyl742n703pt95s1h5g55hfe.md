## Deciding the Blogging Platform

Have been wanting to make it a practice to consistently write. Before even starting to write. Always a lot of time has gone by in deciding the ideal platform. This led to procrastination. I started on platforms like Dev. to, Ghost, Medium. Struggled to continue and stopped. 

## 😕 **Why the confusion?** 

More options more confusion. Period.
For years I optimized for building. Spent a lot of time figuring out should I build the platform from scratch, or maybe use a CMS, use Hugo because the themes looked cool and many other friends were using it, then thought of Pelican as it was Python-based and I could customize it if needed. 

The more blogs you visit, the more ideas you get. As a result, my own blog seemed to be less good than the rest. Ironically, the metric for comparison was never the quality of writing instead the look and feel of the blog. 
 
## **Available Options**


- dev.to
- medium.com
- hashnode.com
- Ghost
- Pelican
- Hugo

## **Why Hashnode?**


- **Platform** - It is pre-built. I don't have to invest my time in building or fixing the platform. Time in hand is finite.

- **Community** - Community already exists. I have the option to decide either to 
share it with the community or not.

- **Blogs Backup** - Backup of all the published blogs is available on my personal Github. No data loss.  And, making it easy to migrate in the future if needed.   

- **Distraction free** - Distraction free interface


## 🎯 **Learning from Indecisiveness and Staying with the Problem for Longer**


- Optimize for one thing at a time.
- Purpose of starting the blog is to get better at writing. Let go of the itch to build.
- Don't compare. It's a trap. 
- Don't worry and occupy your mind with platform-related things.

**✍️ Only one single-minded focus is to Write. **


## 🤓 **Why I decided to write this post?** 

To have why I started as a reminder. When next time my mind plays the game of switching a platform.

🤔 Did you also face the same problem? How did you decide on your platform?
