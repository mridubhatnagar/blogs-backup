## Deciding the Blogging Platform

Have been wanting to make it a practice to consistently write. Before even starting to write. Always a lot of time went by in deciding the ideal platform. This led to procrastination. I started writing on platforms like Dev. to, Ghost, Medium. Struggled to continue and stopped. 

## üòï **Why the confusion?** 


- #### **More options more confusion. Period.**

For years I optimized for building. Spent a lot of time figuring out should I build the platform from scratch, or maybe use a CMS, use Hugo because the themes looked cool and many other friends were using it, then thought of Pelican as it was Python-based and I could customize it if needed. 

The more blogs you visit, the more ideas you get. As a result, my own blog seemed to be less good than the rest. Ironically, the metric for comparison was never the quality of writing instead the look and feel of the blog. 


- #### **Developer Bias**

Asking developer friends which platform to write your blog on is the same as asking them which programming language is a good first programming language? 

Lot of bias leads to analysis paralysis.

 
## **Available Options**


- [dev.to](https://dev.to/)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/)
- [Hashnode](https://hasnode.com/)
- [Ghost](https://ghost.com/)
- [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
-  [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) 

## **Why Hashnode?**


- **Platform** - It is pre-built. You don't have to invest your time in building or fixing the platform. Time in hand is finite.

- **Community** - Community already exists. You have the option to decide either to 
share your write up with the community or not.

- **Blogs Backup** - Backup of all the published blogs is available on your personal Github. No data loss.  And, making it easy to migrate in the future if needed.   

- **Distraction free** - Distraction free interface


## üéØ **Learning from Indecisiveness and Staying with the Problem for Longer**


- Optimize for one thing at a time.
- Purpose of starting the blog is to get better at writing. Let go of the itch to build.
- Don't compare. It's a trap. 
- Don't worry and do not occupy your mind with platform-related things.
- Remove anything that increases friction in your writing workflow.

**‚úçÔ∏è Only one single-minded focus is to Write. **


## ü§ì **Why I decided to write this post?** 

When next time my mind plays the trick to switch the platform. This post will 
be a reminder of why I started.

ü§î Did you also face the same problem? How did you decide on your platform?
